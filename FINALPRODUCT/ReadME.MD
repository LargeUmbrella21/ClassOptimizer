1. Creating Spreadsheets- The Program Requires 2 spreadsheets, one containing the Class names and number of spots, and the other containing the student names, ranks, and availability (will be attached to form)
  1. Class Spread
    - First column will be called ‘Class’ and second column will be called ‘Spots’ (needs to be exact for program)
  2. Student spread - This spreadsheet will come from the form	
  - Since it checks for column, the first name question must be called “First Name”, second name column “Last Name” and both should be short answer questions
    For the rankings, the question name should be “Rank”, and it should be a multiple choice grid, with rows as the class names, and columns as the ranks
  - For availability, the class names must be exactly the same, and the question name should be “Available”, with the class names being rows, and Available being column 1, and not available being column 2. (the formatting should be the same as the Spring 2025 form)
    The available section should look something like this
  - Any other questions or grids should be fine, such as the number of years TAing, as long as those 3 steps are made for the form, and all the class names match up between the two spreadsheets, and the rank and available questions
  3. Download both spreadsheets (the one linked in the form and the one made for classes) as .xlsx files

2. Download and UNZIP - to run the program, you need to download the folder (which contains CBC and the executable), and extract it
  Locate the Zip File:
    The program files may be provided in a zip archive (e.g., dist.zip).
    Find the zip file you received or downloaded.
  Extract the Zip File:
    Right-click on the zip file.
    Choose Extract All... or Extract Here (depending on your operating system).
    Select the location where you want to extract the files (e.g., a new folder or the desktop).
  Go to the extracted folder and double click SpreadIMPORT2.exe

3. Using the Program
Double click on the exe file - It might get flagged by system for being untrusted (this is fine its because its self mad I promise it's not a virus)
  A command terminal should appear and load (this may take a couple seconds)
File Upload
  When the file box appears, navigate to the student ranking .xlsx file and double click it
  The first box will disappear and a second one will appear. Double click on the classes .xlsx file
  MAKE SURE TO DO RANKING AND AVAILABILITY SPREADSHEET FIRST
The program should then run (may take up to a minute based on size) and spit out

4. Suggestions
Sometimes class names might have a lot of syntax, meaning there is a higher chance some class names might be misspelled. It might be better to just make the names the professor, the class number, or the block
Use code names for classes before downloading if the original spreadsheets don’t work.
  For example, after all the results are in, go into the linked spreadsheet, and change all class names to something simpler 
  Rank [1020: Hoos Connected (Nagel; M 4-515)] => Rank [ClassOne]
  You must also change the classname in the class spreadsheet sheet as well (have separate doc telling you codename for each class)
This code is syntax heavy, meaning that any difference in class name or question name or column name may cause it not to work
